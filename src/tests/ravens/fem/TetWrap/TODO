All the internal STL containers could be replaced by tetgen's data structures,
so that we don't have to store everything in memory twice. However, the PCL
data strucures are typically small, so this is not an issue most of the times.

Rethink the memory management. The mesh of a surface should only be calculated
if it hasn't been already and stored somewhere. Maybe also place the larger
objects onto the heap and do RAII.
